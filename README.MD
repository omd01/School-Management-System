The School Management System is a PHP-based website designed to efficiently store and manage records of school students, teachers, and the library. It offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of storing and accessing vital information. In addition to record-keeping, the website also provides a contact form that allows users to send messages easily.

The primary objective of the School Management System is to centralize student-related data, enabling administrators to maintain accurate records of student profiles. This includes personal details, academic information, attendance records, and contact information. Teachers can also access this data to track student progress and communicate effectively with parents.

Furthermore, the system offers a comprehensive platform for managing teacher information. It allows administrators to create and maintain teacher profiles, including qualifications, experience, and contact details. This facilitates effective communication and enables administrators to assign subjects and classes to teachers efficiently.

The School Management System also features a library management module. It enables librarians to organize and track books, manage borrowing and returning processes, and generate reports on library activities. Students and teachers can search for books, view availability, and place requests through the system.

In conclusion, the School Management System is a PHP-based website that serves as a centralized platform for storing and managing student, teacher, and library records. Its user-friendly interface, along with the contact form feature, enhances communication and facilitates efficient administration within the school environment.
